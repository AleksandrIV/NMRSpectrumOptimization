This repository contains the implementation of a gradient descent-based optimization algorithm for automatically determining spin system parameters (chemical shifts, J-coupling constants, relaxation rates, and intensity corrections) from experimental NMR spectra. The method is designed to improve the accuracy of metabolite identification in complex biological samples without manual intervention.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for metabolomics, but manual processing of spectra remains a bottleneck. This project introduces a model built in PyTorch that optimizes parameters via gradient descent to match experimental data

The method has been validated on common amino acids, including L-proline.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
